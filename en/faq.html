Sexual exploitation includes abusing a position of vulnerability for sexual purposes. The SGB acknowledges that we frequently work amongst vulnerable populations and that there may be an inherently unequal power dynamic between staff and beneficiaries of assistance.

The definitions are concerned with the behaviour of UN personnel and partners and not with the person against whom the act is committed. In addition to the SGB, a number of UN entities and partners have a policy regarding workplace harassment dealing with harassing, abusive behaviour at the workplace. Any act that constitutes sexual exploitation, sexual abuse or sexual harassment is serious misconduct and should be reported.

    <div class="text_content">
      <p>The focus is not on the individual or whether there is consent, but on the nature of the relationship. If the relationship is an abuse of a position of vulnerability, differential power or trust for sexual purposes, it is sexual exploitation and is prohibited. UN personnel are often in a position of considerable power over the local population. UN personnel have money, food and shelter whereas the local population might often be very vulnerable and not always have easy access to these essentials. Because of the risk of abuse of power, sexual relationships between UN personnel and the local population are strongly discouraged.</p>

    <div class="text_content">
      <p>Sexual relationships between United Nations staff or UN‐related personnel and beneficiaries of assistance are &ldquo;strongly discouraged&rdquo; (SGB, section 3.2(d)). Sexual relationships between UN staff and beneficiaries of assistance are strongly discouraged because they are likely to be based on inherently unequal power dynamics. Where a UN peacekeeping operation has a mandate to serve the population at large, &ldquo;beneficiaries of assistance&rdquo;<br />Sexual Exploitation and Abuse should be broadly interpreted to cover the local population.<br />However, the focus should be on whether the relationship is an abuse of a position of vulnerability, differential power or trust for sexual purposes. Because of the risk of sexual exploitation occurring, relationships between UN staff and beneficiaries are strongly discouraged. The SGB does not impose a blanket prohibition on such relationships but any relationship that is sexually exploitative or sexually abusive is prohibited by the SGB. The determination of whether a relationship with a beneficiary of assistance is sexually exploitative or sexually abusive is made by the employing organization on a case‐by‐ case basis.<br />The standards in the SGB are minimum standards of behaviour. If there is any doubt, the relationship should not be entered into. UN personnel are expected to uphold the highest standards of conduct. Even the perception of sexual exploitation and abuse can result in damage to the credibility of the individual and the Organization.</p>

The SGB is the minimum standard of conduct, irrespective of local laws. When you accept an assignment with the UN, you accept to abide by its standards of conduct. The UN is held to a high standard of conduct. Furthermore, prostitution in war‐ravaged societies, developing countries and in countries hosting a peacekeeping mission frequently involves extremely vulnerable women and children, including persons who have been trafficked for sexual exploitation. In most communities, the vast majority of women in prostitution don&rsquo;t want to be there. Few seek it out or choose it, and most are desperate to leave it. The lack of economic options for women in vulnerable circumstances may result in prostitution and exploitative sex being one of the few avenues they have for obtaining money to meet basic needs.</p>

      <p>Prostitution is not a victimless crime. On the contrary, it is well documented that prostitution is inherently harmful and dehumanizing, and in certain communities may fuel trafficking in persons, a form of modern‐day slavery. The vast majority of women in prostitution don&rsquo;t want to be there. Few seek it out or choose it, and most are desperate to leave it. Field research in nine countries concluded that 60‐75 % of women in prostitution were raped and 70‐95 % were physically assaulted. A recent study has revealed high rates of post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in prostitutes stemming from physical and sexual assault.<br />The study included male and female prostitutes aged from 12 to 61 who worked on the street and in brothels in Africa, Thailand, Turkey and the United States. In the study, the measure of PTSD severity of prostitutes was higher than that of Vietnam War veterans.</p>

  <div class="text">
    <div class="text_content">
      <p>In the UN Secretariat, ST/SGB/2008/5 (Prohibition of discrimination, harassment, including sexual harassment, and abuse of authority) defines &ldquo;sexual harassment&rdquo; as any unwelcome sexual advance, request for sexual favour, verbal or physical conduct<br />or gesture of a sexual nature, or any other behaviour of a sexual nature that might reasonably be expected or be perceived to cause offence or humiliation to another, when such conduct interferes with work, is made a condition of employment or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment. Similar definitions exist in the UN Funds and Programmes.<br />The SGB on sexual exploitation and sexual abuse defines the term &ldquo;sexual exploitation&rdquo; as any actual or attempted abuse of a position of vulnerability, differential power, or trust, for sexual purposes, including, but not limited to, profiting monetarily, socially or politically from the sexual exploitation of another. It defines the term &ldquo;sexual abuse&rdquo; as the actual or threatened physical intrusion of a sexual nature, whether by force or under unequal or coercive conditions.<br />There is often confusion about whether a particular action or conduct would constitute sexual harassment, sexual exploitation or sexual abuse. Sexual harassment is associated with the workplace. Not all sexual harassment involves an abuse of a position of vulnerability, differential power or trust or the actual or threatened physical intrusion of a sexual nature. If it does, it also constitutes sexual exploitation or sexual abuse. Sexual harassment and sexual exploitation and abuse are all considered serious misconduct. All three should be reported.

      <p>On 21 December 2007, the General Assembly adopted the &ldquo;United Nations Comprehensive Strategy on Assistance and Support to Victims of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse by United Nations Staff and Related Personnel&rdquo; (A/RES/62/214). The strategy gives the United Nations an initial 2‐year mandate to help victims to access the services they need as a result of the sexual exploitation or abuse. These services may include medical treatment, counseling, legal assistance, social support, or material care such as that which is needed for victim protection.<br />In addition, the strategy commits the UN to helping children born as a result of sexual exploitation and abuse to access needed assistance.</p>

  <div class="text">
    <div class="text_content">
      <p>The intention of the strategy is to have one victim assistance programme in each country serving all victims of UN staff and related personnel, so that care remains consistent regardless of the agency associated with the perpetrator. In order to provide the assistance established under the strategy, &ldquo;victim support facilitators&rdquo; would facilitate victims&rsquo; access to services on the ground, whether by way of referrals or a greater helping hand. In most contexts, personnel of implementing partners will serve as &ldquo;victim support facilitators.&rdquo;</p>

  <div class="text">
    <div class="text_content">
      <p>No. UN Member States have not authorized direct UN‐supported financial compensation for victims.</p>

  <a href="javascript:;" class="open">Why is the victim assistance strategy important?</a>

  <div class="text">
    <div class="text_content">
      <p>Responding adequately to the needs of victims is a moral imperative given that, were it not for the UN&rsquo;s presence, the abuse or exploitation would most likely not have occurred. It also restores the reputation of the UN as an organization that acts responsibly towards the communities it serves.</p>
